# uKOS-X TestRom

(c) 2025-20xx, Edo. Franzi, 2025-01-01

## Objectives

The TestRom is intended to experiment new SOCs/CPUs and specific peripherals in order to prepare and to create the necessary files for a minimal porting of µKOS-X. This process takes place step-by-step. The minimal objective is:

1. Mastering the GPIOs (e.g. for LEDs and for logic analyser synchros)
2. Mastering the UARTs (minimal I/O channel)
3. Mastering the Timers
4. Mastering the interruptions
5. Mastering the basic contex switch

This code is a collection of minimal stand-alone programs written for the described purpose.

### Important files

**Folders _Commun/Include & _Commun/Runtime: Commun files to all the targets.**

| File                         | Purpose                           | Comment   |
