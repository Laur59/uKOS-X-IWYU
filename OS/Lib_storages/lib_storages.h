 * \defgroup Lib_storages Library for storage manager
 *
 * \brief Storage manager system calls
 *
 * The Lib_storages library unifies access to memory devices and data stores.
 * It ensures that storage is reliable, efficient, and simple to command.
 *
 * The storage manager offers a common interface. Whether card or flash,
 * it allows programmes to read and write data without caring for details.
 *
 * The sdcard manager controls removable cards. It brings familiar media to
 * embedded systems, where files can be logged, shared, or updated easily.
 *
 * The serialFlash manager governs serial flash memory. It provides fast
 * and persistent space for firmware, assets, and critical information.
 *
 * Together these managers make Lib_storages a safe foundation for data.
 * From portable media to embedded chips, all is handled with equal care.
