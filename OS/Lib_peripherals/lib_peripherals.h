 * \defgroup Lib_peripherals Library for handling the peripherals
 *
 * \brief Peripheral manager system calls
 *
 * The Lib_peripherals library provides managers for the many devices that
 * link a system to the real world. Each manager ensures control and clarity.
 *
 * The adc manager reads analogue inputs, turning voltage into digital data
 * that can be measured, stored, and acted upon with precision.
 *
 * The battery manager observes charge and discharge, protecting energy and
 * extending the life of the system with careful supervision.
 *
 * The i2c manager opens a channel for two-wire communication. It enables
 * sensors and modules to share information in a simple, ordered way.
 *
 * The imager manager captures pictures and streams, bringing vision into
 * embedded design and allowing machines to perceive their environment.
 *
 * The imu manager delivers motion and orientation through an inertial unit.
 * It makes navigation possible and supports balance and control.
 *
 * The spi manager manages fast serial links. Devices exchange data at high
 * speed with low overhead, keeping systems both agile and efficient.
 *
 * The led manager provides clear signals of state. A flash of light tells
 * the user what the system feels, whether alert, calm, or in fault.
 *
 * The switch manager handles digital inputs. A press or release becomes a
 * firm command, giving the user direct influence over the machine.
 *
 * The temperature manager measures heat and ensures stability. It allows
 * the system to adjust, protect itself, and maintain safe operation.
 *
 * The watchdog manager safeguards the system. If a fault prevents progress,
 * the watchdog restores order by resetting and recovering control.
 *
 * Together these managers give Lib_peripherals the means to sense, signal,
 * and survive. They turn a circuit into a responsive and reliable partner.
