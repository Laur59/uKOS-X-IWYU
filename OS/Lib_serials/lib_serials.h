 * \defgroup Lib_serials Library for Serial Communication Manager
 *
 * \brief Serial manager system calls
 *
 * The Lib_serials library offers managers for communication across many
 * channels. It unifies serial links and ensures that data flows with order.
 *
 * The serial manager provides a common foundation. It abstracts details,
 * so that higher layers may send and receive bytes without confusion.
 *
 * The urtx manager controls UART lines. It enables traditional serial I/O,
 * still essential in embedded design, debugging, and configuration.
 *
 * The cdcx manager extends serial links through USB CDC. By appearing as a
 * virtual port, it joins the flexibility of USB with the clarity of UART.
 *
 * The wfi0 manager opens the path to wireless. Using the ESP32 module, it
 * delivers Wi-Fi connectivity, bringing networks into embedded systems.
 *
 * Together these managers make Lib_serials a bridge between machines and
 * their environment. From a simple cable to a wireless link, all is aligned.
