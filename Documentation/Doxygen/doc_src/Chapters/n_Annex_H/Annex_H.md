# 🌈  Annex H, Misra - C µKOS-X compliance matrix

## Introduction

The µKOS-X project source code has been developed with a strong emphasis on software reliability, and as such, it is **nearly fully compliant** with the **MISRA C Coding Standards** (Motor Industry Software Reliability Association). These standards were established to promote safe, secure, and robust programming practices in the C language, particularly for use in **mission-critical automotive systems** where predictable behaviour is essential.

The **MISRA guidelines** are widely recognised across safety-critical industries and have become a de facto standard for high-integrity software development. The consortium behind these standards comprises prominent industrial players and academic partners, including **Delco Electronics, Ford Motor Company, Jaguar Cars Ltd., Lotus Engineering, Lucas Electronics, Rolls-Royce, Rover Group Ltd.**, and several universities - all dedicated to advancing safety and reliability in embedded and automotive systems.

Comprehensive information about these standards can be found on the official MISRA website: [http://www.misra.org.uk](http://www.misra.org.uk/).

µKOS-X includes a **detailed compliance matrix** that maps its coding practices against the original **MISRA C:1998 ruleset**, providing transparency on adherence and identifying any exceptions. Due to the µKernel’s robust architectural design and disciplined coding approach, only **minor adjustments** are needed for complete compliance. In fact, µKOS-X was architected from the outset with many of MISRA’s principles inherently built in — reflecting a long-standing commitment to **software quality, maintainability, and safety**.

Notes

1. µKOS-X assembly code is encapsulated by C macros located in the macros.h file. The only exception is the inline assembly code used by the µKernel for the context switching, for the exception crash management and for the initialisation of the stack pointer in the **crt0**. For readability reason, it is better to maintain the assembler code “visible” in these part of the project.
2. µKOS-X uses the gcc implementation.
3. µKOS-X assumes that the compiler will catch those .
4. Too restrictive in embedded.
5. Computer specific.
6. µKOS-X µKernel does not use any dynamic memory allocation. However, some operating system modules (not mandatory) could use memo_malloc and derivative. In SoC, for footprint memory reasons, it is necessary to dynamically share memory regions; in this case, memo_malloc is unavoidable.
7. µKOS-X uses its own exit and not the stdlib one.
